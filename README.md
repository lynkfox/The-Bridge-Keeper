# The-Bridge-Keeper
A small javascript project, in order to show my progress in the language.

The Bridge Keeper reenacts, in an interactive way, the Monty Python movie: King Arthur and the Holy Grail scene of the Bridge Keeper. 


# What is this for?

This is a very small, very basic project in Javascript. 

## Primary Goal

To show potential teachers or potential employeers my progress through learning Javascript.

## Secondary Goal

To show potential employeers my ability to use gitHub and similiar systems for project development.

## Additional Goals

To show project iteration and feature definition as the scope and depth of the project continues

# Iteration 1 (alert boxes)

This iteration asks the questions using alerts and prompt boxes. 

## Notes from development:

There were multiple bug fixes that were needed. 

Most of it was simple things: 
* 1 infinite loop (forgot a counter increase). 
* Loop counters were off by 1 number. 
* Several times used = instead of == in If statements 
..* and learning that, unlike C# or Java, being a loosely interpreted scripting langauge, having questionNumber=4 in an if statement WILL change the var.
